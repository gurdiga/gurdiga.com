🌱 I’m currently working on my first SaaS: [FeedSubscription.com][0]. It’s tagline is **Uncomplicated content distribution for Bloggers**, and I intend to extend the audience in the near future. 😇

If you want to follow my progress, you can follow [the project blog here][3]. 🤓

To learn more about marketing and sales, I’m reading “[Founding Sales][4]: Sales for founders (and others) in first-time sales roles” by Pete Kazanjy. I have mixed feelings about the material, and I think that is a good thing. 🙂
