title: Make peace

It’s innate for any human being to try to understand how things work. I
will share my reasoning on why my life is as good as it is. I plan to
split my findings into short posts and knit them along the way.

One of the things that served me most is making peace with where I am.
This helps me rest, regain balance, and see clearly what would be a good
next step. Unhappiness would drain the mental energy and fog the clarity
that I’d need to see the solution and work my way to it. This is why I
think that in hard times it’s wise to first take a break, regain balance
and clear vision, and only then act or decide what to do. The break can
be as simple as a walk, enjoy a coffee, or take a shower. It can also be
a couple of days off, depending on the issue.

Sometimes, when I think I did something that I’m not content about, I
would first anxiously try think of how to prevent that from happening
again. But then I remember that this is not a good time to make
long-term decisions, and instead try to find a way to calm down, make
peace with what happened, and only then think about solutions or
preventive measures.

Make peace first, and then everything else.
