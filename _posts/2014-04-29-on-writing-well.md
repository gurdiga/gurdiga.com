This morning I got to the “Business Writing: Writing in Your Job”
chapter in the “On Writing Well” book by William Zinsser. I found many
things I wanted to write down and share, but instead of retelling it I
thought I will just quote a good chunk of it and let you enjoy the
original. It’s pretty long for a blog article, but it’s an easy and
pleasant reading. I’ll start with the second paragraph since I think it
goes straight to the point. Here it goes.

--- quote begin ---


Although this is a book about writing, it’s not just for writers. Its
principles apply to everyone who is expected to do some writing as part
of his or her daily employment. The memo, the business letter, the
administrative report, the financial analysis, the marketing proposal,
the note to the boss, the fax, the e-mail, the Post-it—all the pieces of
paper that circulate through your office every day are forms of writing.
Take them seriously. Countless careers rise or fall on the ability or
the inability of employees to state a set of facts, summarize a meeting
or present an idea coherently.

Most people work for institutions: businesses, banks, insurance firms,
law firms, government agencies, school systems, non-profit organizations
and other entities. Many of those people are managers whose writing goes
out to the public: the president addressing the stockholders, the banker
explaining a change in procedure, the school principal writing a
newsletter to parents. Whoever they are, they tend to be so afraid of
writing that their sentences lack all humanity—and so do their
institutions. It’s hard to imagine that these are real places where real
men and women come to work every morning.

But just because people work for an institution, they don’t have to
write like one. Institutions can be warmed up. Administrators can be
turned into human beings. Information can be imparted clearly and
without pomposity. You only have to remember that readers identify with
people, not with abstractions like “profitability,” or with Latinate
nouns like “utilization” and “implementation,” or with inert
constructions in which nobody can be visualized doing something:
“pre-feasibility studies are in the paperwork stage.”

Nobody has made the point better than George Orwell in his translation
into modern bureaucratic fuzz of this famous verse from Ecclesiastes:


> I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift,
> nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
> riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but
> time and chance happeneth to them all.


Orwell’s version goes:


> Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the
> conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits
> no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a
> considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken
> into account.


First notice how the two passages look. The first one at the top invites
us to read it. The words are short and have air around them; they convey
the rhythms of human speech. The second one is clotted with long words.
It tells us instantly that a ponderous mind is at work. We don’t want to
go anywhere with a mind that expresses itself in such suffocating
language. We don’t even start to read.

Also notice what the two passages say. Gone from the second one are the
short words and vivid images of everyday life—the race and the battle,
the bread and the riches—and in their place have waddled the long and
flabby nouns of generalized meaning. Gone is any sense of what one
person did (“I returned”) or what he realized (“saw”) about one of
life’s central mysteries: the capriciousness of fate.

Let me illustrate how this disease infects the writing that most people
do in their jobs. I’ll use school principals as my first example, not
because they are the worst offenders (they aren’t) but because I happen
to have such an example. My points, however, are intended for all the
men and women who work in all the organizations where language has lost
its humanity and nobody knows what the people in charge are talking
about.

My encounter with the principals began when I got a call from Ernest B.
Fleishman, superintendent of schools in Greenwich, Connecticut. “We’d
like you to come and ‘dejargonize’ us,” he said. “We don’t think we can
teach students to write unless all of us at the top of the school system
clean up our own writing.” He said he would send me some typical
materials that had originated within the system. His idea was for me to
analyze the writing and then conduct a workshop.

What appealed to me was the willingness of Dr. Fleishman and his
colleagues to make themselves vulnerable; vulnerability has a strength
of its own. We decided on a date, and soon a fat envelope arrived. It
contained various internal memos and mimeographed newsletters that had
been mailed to parents from the town’s 16 elementary, junior and senior
high schools.

The newsletters had a cheery and informal look. Obviously the system was
making an effort to communicate warmly with its families. But even at
first glance certain chilly phrases caught my eye (“prioritized
evaluative procedures,” “modified departmentalized schedule”), and one
principal promised that his school would provide “enhanced positive
learning environments.” Just as obviously the system wasn’t
communicating as warmly as it thought it was.

I studied the principals’ material and divided it into good and bad
examples. On the appointed morning in Greenwich I found 40 principals
and curriculum coordinators assembled and eager to learn. I told them I
could only applaud them for submitting to a process that so threatened
their identity. In the national clamor over why Johnny can’t write, Dr.
Fleishman was the first adult in my experience who admitted that youth
has no monopoly on verbal sludge.

I told the principals that we want to think of the men and women who run
our children’s schools as people not unlike ourselves. We are suspicious
of pretentiousness, of all the fad words that the social scientists have
coined to avoid making themselves clear to ordinary mortals. I urged
them to be natural. How we write and how we talk is how we define
ourselves.

I asked them to listen to how they were defining themselves to the
community. I had made copies of certain bad examples, changing the names
of the schools and the principals. I explained that I would read some of
the examples aloud. Later we would see if they could turn what they had
written into plain English. This was my first example:

> Dear Parent:
> 
> We have established a special phone communication system to provide
> additional opportunities for parent input. During this year we will
> give added emphasis to the goal of communication and utilize a variety
> of means to accomplish this goal. Your inputs, from the unique
> position as a parent, will help us to plan and implement an
> educational plan that meets the needs of your child. An open dialogue,
> feedback and sharing of information between parents and teachers will
> enable us to work with your child in the most effective manner.
> 
> DR. GEORGE B. JONES<br/>
> Principal


That’s the kind of communication I don’t want to receive, unique though
my parent inputs might be. I want to be told that the school is going to
make it easier for me to telephone the teachers and that they hope I’ll
call often to discuss how my children are getting along. Instead the
parent gets junk: “special phone communication system,” “added emphasis
to the goal of communication,” “plan and implement an educational plan.”
As for “open dialogue, feedback and sharing of information,” they are
three ways of saying the same thing.

Dr. Jones is clearly a man who means well, and his plan is one we all
want: a chance to pick up the phone and tell the principal what a great
kid Johnny is despite that unfortunate incident in the playground last
Tuesday. But Dr. Jones doesn’t sound like a person I want to call. In
fact, he doesn’t sound like a person. His message could have been tapped
out by a computer. He is squandering a rich resource: himself.

Another example I chose was a “Principal’s Greeting” sent to parents at
the start of the school year. It consisted of two paragraphs that were
very different:

> Fundamentally, Foster is a good school. Pupils who require help in
> certain subjects or study skills areas are receiving special
> attention. In the school year ahead we seek to provide enhanced
> positive learning environments. Children, and staff, must work in an
> atmosphere that is conducive to learning. Wide varieties of
> instructional materials are needed. Careful attention to individual
> abilities and learning styles is required. Cooperation between school
> and home is extremely important to the learning process. All of us
> should be aware of desired educational objectives for every child.
>
> Keep informed about what is planned for our children this year and let
> us know about your own questions and about any special needs your
> child may have. I have met many of you in the first few weeks. Please
> continue to stop in to introduce yourself or to talk about Foster. I
> look forward to a very productive year for all of us.
>
> DR. RAY B. DAWSON <br/>
> Principal


In the second paragraph I’m being greeted by a person; in the first I’m
hearing from an educator. I like the real Dr. Dawson of Paragraph 2. He
talks in warm and comfortable phrases: “Keep informed,” “let us know,”
“I have met,” “Please continue,” “I look forward.”

By contrast, Educator Dawson of Paragraph 1 never uses “I” or even
suggests a sense of “I.” He falls back on the jargon of his profession,
where he feels safe, not stopping to notice that he really isn’t telling
the parent anything. What are “study skills areas,” and how do they
differ from “subjects”? What are “enhanced positive learning
environments,” and how do they differ from “an atmosphere that is
conducive to learning”? What are “wide varieties of instructional
materials”: pencils, textbooks, filmstrips? What exactly are “learning
styles”? What “educational objectives” are “desired”?

The second paragraph, in short, is warm and personal; the other is
pedantic and vague. That was a pattern I found repeatedly. Whenever the
principals wrote to notify the parents of some human detail, they wrote
with humanity:

> It seems that traffic is beginning to pile up again in front of the
> school. If you can possibly do so, please come to the rear of the
> school for your child at the end of the day.
> 
> I would appreciate it if you would speak with your children about
> their behavior in the cafeteria. Many of you would be totally dismayed
> if you could observe the manners of your children while they are
> eating. Check occasionally to see if they owe money for lunch.
> Sometimes children are very slow in repaying.

But when the educators wrote to explain how they proposed to do their
educating, they vanished without a trace:

> In this document you will find the program goals and objectives that
> have been identified and prioritized. Evaluative procedures for the
> objectives were also established based on acceptable criteria.
> 
> Prior to the implementation of the above practice, students were given
> very little exposure to multiple choice questions. It is felt that the
> use of practice questions correlated to the unit that a student is
> presently studying has had an extremely positive effect as the test
> scores confirm.

After I had read various good and bad examples, the principals began to
hear the difference between their true selves and their educator selves.
The problem was how to close the gap. I recited my four articles of
faith: clarity, simplicity, brevity and humanity. I explained about
using active verbs and avoiding “concept nouns.” I told them not to use
the special vocabulary of education as a crutch; almost any subject can
be made accessible in good English.

These were all basic tenets, but the principals wrote them down as if
they had never heard them before—and maybe they hadn’t, or at least not
for many years. Perhaps that’s why bureaucratic prose becomes so turgid,
whatever the bureaucracy. Once an administrator rises to a certain
level, nobody ever points out to him again the beauty of a simple
declarative sentence, or shows him how his writing has become swollen
with pompous generalizations.
