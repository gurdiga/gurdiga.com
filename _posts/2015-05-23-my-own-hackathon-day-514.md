Today it’s a different day, it’s Saturday: until afternoon I dug
channels for our drainage system in the back-yard. I did my best to
escape out of there around 16:00 and got to the office.

Not a lot of code done today, just little refactoring, a bit of
restructuring, a bit of thinking and guessing about what should I do
next. I think it’s still useful.

Bought a React video course on Frontend Masters. The reason is that I’d
like to see how someone experienced with React structures the components
and the app itself.

One thing that I was thinking today while rambling around the code is
that it seems like CSS-related effects like :hover, :focus look a lot
more natural. So far I only have a small CSS file where I have a 4 rules
that are truly global. I’ve tried to get hover effect in React, and it
kind of works, but it doesn’t feel natural at all, so I think these
effects will be the next to go into my global CSS file.

That’s about it.
