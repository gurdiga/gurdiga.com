Yesterday I traveled to Bucharest (and I have slept the first half of
the today to recover).

Today I’ve put together a quick marketing website: executori.org. It’s
built on Weebly and gives a glimpse about what the app is about, and
also a signup form to collect emails — an idea about the signup from the
most recent episode of “Startups For the Rest of Us.” It’s something
that I had started before and hearing this now made me push it online.
The emails are collected to my MailChimp account.

Tomorrow I want to do some work on the other little side-project I’ve
got running, and then I will work on setting some infrastructure for
automated testing.
