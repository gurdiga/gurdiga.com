Last week I helped a friend move their blog subscribers from FeedBurner to Follow.it.

The experience I had during this migration was notably smooth, and this was not because of the well-made tech, but due to the very helpful support person.

My friend mentioned Follow.it because FeedBurner is being sunset, and they had 5 active blogs that they wanted to move. It was Saturday morning and I wrote their support because of a technical issue I faced when trying it out. Blogger doesnâ€™t allow me to add a custom meta tab, not it allows me to upload a random HTML file â€” and these were the two ways to confirm blog ownership in Follow.it.

The support person answered in 8 minutes. They confirmed the change manually, and asked me to send them the CSV subscriber list exported from FeedBurner, and also a screenshot of the FeedBurner dashboard â€” Iâ€™m guessing this is for them to make sure that Iâ€™m not doing some kind of social engineering trick.

This was just plain old WOW!

Now Iâ€™m thinking about trying their service on this blog. ðŸ¤”
