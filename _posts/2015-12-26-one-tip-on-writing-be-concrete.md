Every now and then, I set out to write an article about some Grand Idea®
that just came to me. It usually happens when I read something dramatic
rant on something.

I did it again a few days ago, and this time I leaned back in my chair
staring at the 2 and a half pages in my GDocs and wondered: What’s wrong
with this text?¹

One thing that I could quickly spot was that it was too abstract: I was
trying to compare to very high-level ideas/opinions and draw some
conclusion of my own, but the overall idea just didn’t seem to click.²

And then I realized that this was exactly the point: Generalizations are
generally general and vague! And this is why it just wasn’t obvious what
I was trying to say.

OK: without further ado, this week’s Grand Idea® is that I should stick
to concrete ideas. I even made a note in my template:


> Tip: Write about concrete things in concrete contexts; this makes it
> easier to express and understand.

This is it! 8-)

¹ This is a trick I have recently picked from “The 5 Elements of
Effective Thinking.”

² Although it was still useful to follow that labyrinth and actually see
that it doesn’t lead to anything substantial. It’s then easy to let it
go and tack it off my mind, which is a good thing too!
