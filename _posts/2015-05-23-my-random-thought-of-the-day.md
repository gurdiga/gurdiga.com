Having your own business is in many ways similar to being employed: you
make a long-term commitment, you take on some responsibility, you do the
work, and you get payed for it.

The one thing that I see as a benefit with having your own business is
complete freedom in how you solve a problem. As always, with more
freedom also comes with more responsibility, but I think itâ€™s a very
good tradeoff.
